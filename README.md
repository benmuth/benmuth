### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben! I've been programming for a few years now, and I attended a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in fall of 2022.

- I'm currently working on [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox) and a [tool for collecting scientific papers](https://github.com/benmuth/papers-dl)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [performance-aware programming](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/welcome-to-the-performance-aware), Zig, backend web development, and more!
